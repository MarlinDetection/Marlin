# Docker Containers

We provide two Docker containers:

1. `marlin`: Run the Marlin detector using your own software-defined radios.
2. `marlin-data`: Visualize our network captures and plot new data. This container does not require specialized hardware.

Instructions for installation and usage of each container are included in each respective directory.
